            Once upon a time there was an old mother {{ madlibs.Person }} who had three little {{ madlibs.Person }}
                 and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she {{ madlibs.Adjective }} them out
                 into the {{ madlibs.Place }} to {{ madlibs.Adjective }} their fortunes.

            The first little {{ madlibs.noun }} was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all, and he built
                 his house out of straw. The second little {{ madlibs.noun2 }} worked a little bit harder
                 but he was somewhat lazy too, and he built his house out of sticks.
                 Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.

            The third little {{ madlibs.noun3 }} worked hard all day and built his house with bricks.
                 It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney.
                 It looked like it could withstand the strongest {{ madlibs.Thing }}.
